**Joint Travel Behavior** refers to how people choose to travel when considering the travel of other household members or persons in their social networks. Children under driving age need to be driven to activities by parents, which requires coordination of household schedules. Household members often need to decide how to share vehicles to conduct daily activities. Some activities are more likely to be conducted with other people, like eating a meal or socializing, whereas other activities are more likely to be conducted alone like commuting to work.

### Household Travel Behavior

#### Household Day Patterns

Bradley and Vovsha proposed a system for modeling joint choice of daily activity patterns for all household members [^1].

A household day pattern model was developed for the South California Association of Governments recently that uses a multiple discrete continuous extreme value model of household activity generation that jointly predicts the activity participation decisions of all individuals in a household by activity purpose and the precise combination of individuals participating[^2].
